The Haskell study group uses the mailing list (please join it):
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lambda-lounge-ut

And also the wiki:
https://github.com/LambdaLoungeUT/haskell-course/wiki

Please add your name and a link to your blog or something about you at:
https://github.com/LambdaLoungeUT/haskell-course/wiki/participants

See the wiki page for the current and past study material:

--------------------------------------------------
MATERIAL

The ideas for the course are (but I still need to sync up with Levi,
who is traveling at the moment):

1. Brent Yorgey's "Introduction to Haskell" course :
   http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/

   This course has exercises that are typical (e.g, towers-of-hanoi)
   and practical (e.g., validating credit-card numbers, processing log
   files).

2. The NICTA course : https://github.com/NICTA/course

   This course is foundational.  The exercises start by building
   functor, applicative and monad typeclasses from scratch.  It is not
   easy, but the course is well layed out.  After coming up with my
   solutions I have then checked the instructors solutions and learned
   a lot of good Haskell practice as a result.

--------------------------------------------------
PACE

Each month we could do:

- one of Brent's weekly lectures/homeworks
- one (or a smaller part of one) of NICTA's sections (which are based on an ordered sequence of files).

--------------------------------------------------
METHOD

Everyone would read the month's material online and do the exercises
themselves (discussing it along the way in this google group).

Then, each month, in the Lambda Lounge meetings, in a breakout session
after the presentation, we would meet to discuss our solutions, what
we learned, and agree to move forward to the next set of exercises.

--------------------------------------------------
LOOKING FORWARD

Once we get through Brent's course we could then try David Mazieres'
and Bryan O'Sullivan's project-based Stanford course:
