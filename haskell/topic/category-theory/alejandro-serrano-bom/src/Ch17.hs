3 fundamental concepts
- CATEGORIES
- FUNCTORS : transformations between categories
- NATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS : relate two different functors

definitions below have two parts
- data
- laws the data must satisfy

category C given by four pieces of data:
1. set of objects O
2. set of morphisms (i.e., arrows) M
   - each arrow has two associated objects from O: domain and codomain : A -f-> B
3. for all object A in the category
   - identity arrow A -> A
     - represented by id_A or 1_A (drop subscript when context clear)
4. given 2 arrows A --f-> B and B --g-> C
   - composition A --g . f-> C

laws
1. Associativity
   - given A --f-> B
           B --g-> C
           C --h-> D
   - h . (g . f) == (h . g) . f
2. Identity
   - given A --f-> B
   - id_B . f == f . id_A

{-
for functors F and G to take part in a natural transformation: Î·
- each must transform same underlying categories
  - F and G must take same C category into same D category D

To define a natural transformation, data required is a family of arrows
- one per object X in C, F X -> G X
  -  how to take objects transformed by F to objects transformed by G
- each arrow called a component of Î· at X, written Î·X

family of arrows must satisfy NATURALITY CONDITION

{-
when restricted to Haskell Functors (endofunctors for category of Haskell types and functions)
- natural transformation always has shape : F a -> G a (for functors F and G)
- this only defines the components of the natural transformation

when implementing those components
- Haskell semantics prevent having different impls depending on 'a'
  - e.g., could not have different code case of [Int] in safeHead
- functions of form F a -> G a are PARAMETRIC over type 'a'

parametricity is a stronger property than naturality
- every function with shape of components of natural transformation defines a natural transformation
â€” i.e., a free theorem
  - property we know about a function by looking only at its type sig

leads to parametric mappings between functors as Haskell definition of natural transformations:

    type f :=>: g = forall a. f a -> g a (defined above)

like the Functor type class, (:=>:) refers to a specific sort of natural transformation
- e.g., natural transformations between endofunctors for the category of Haskell types and funs

this is enough to understand the construction of monads as monoids.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- p 250 16.3 Monoids in Monoidal Categories
{-
CATEGORIES, FUNCTORS, NATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS : basic parts of category theory

now going to look at specific things needed to describe a monad as a monoid

1st question: what does MONOID mean in context of a category?

Haskell def:

class Monoid m where
  mempty  :: m
  mappend :: m -> m -> m

not amenable for generalizing from category of Haskell types to other categories
- because mempty takes no argument; mappend takes two argument
  - arrows in a category always take exactly one argument

FIX:

categorical point of view for monoid: is thus:

class Monoid m where
  mempty  :: ()     -> m
  mappend :: (m, m) -> m

solved problem of the shape of arrows
- solution assumes category has notion of tuple and notion of unit.
- not all categories have those
- categories that do are called MONOIDAL CATEGORIES

GOAL OF THIS SECTION : describe MONOIDAL CATEGORIES
- then can see a monoid as a generalization of the Monoid type class
  in which tuple and unit  are instantiated to those notions in the corresponding monoidal category

monoidal category C is described by two pieces of DATA
(in addition to elements that make C a regular category)
1. bifunctor biX from CxC  to C
   - functors that take two categories as arguments (instead of single)
     - for Haskell types, bifunctor is tuple constructor (,)
2. An object 1 from C
   - in this section, this object is the type ()

LAWS
1. 1 is identity for the bifunctor b
   - 1 biX X == X biX 1 == X : X is an arbitrary object of C
2. bifunctor must be associative
   Given any three objects, A, B, and C from C
   A biX (B biX C) == (A biX B) biX C
   where (==) means : natural transformation with inverse should exist between all constructions

-- p 251

category may have more than one way to be monoidal
e.g., in category of types, another structure in addition to tuples
- bifunctor (Either) and object (Void) from category of types
-}

data Void

{-
has no constructor
- cannot create a value of type Void
- cannot pattern match on it

- check Either Void a, Either a Void, and 'a' are isomorphic
-}

removeVoidL :: Either Void a -> a
removeVoidL (Right x) = x
removeVoidL (Left _) = error "impossible"
composeWithVoidL :: a -> Either Void a
composeWithVoidL = Right

{-
TODO: Exercise 16.5 check that Either gives rise to a monoidal category, Void being the identity:
1. For the identity laws, by writing functions from Either a Void to a, and vice versa.
2. For associativity, by writing functions from and to di erent nesting structures

    Either a (Either b c)   and   Either (Either a b) c
-}

-- p 242

{-
summary

notion of monoid only makes sense inside a monoidal category

given the monoidal structure of the bifunctor b with the object 1
a monoid is defined by one object M and two arrows:

    1 --Î·-> M    and  M biX M --Î¼-> M

Î· : unit/identity of the monoid
Î¼ : multiplication of the monoid

can now provide precise definition of Haskellâ€™s Monoid type class in categorical terms
- it is formed by monoids in the monoidal category of Haskell types with respect to tuples.
-}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- p 252 16.4 The Category of Endofunctors

{-
closer to goal of defining monads as monoids
- need to choose the right (monoidal) category to make definition work
  - category of endofunctors : End(C) from any category C

1. objects of category are endofunctors of C (functors that take C to C)
   - type constructors that are instances of Functor type class (e.g., [], Maybe)
   - where C is Haskell types

2. arrows of End(C) are natural transformations between functors
   - functions of form F a -> G a for endofunctors F and G

IDENTITY ARROW for each object
- given each endofunctor F, need natural transformation from F to F
- identity natural transformation : sends each object F X to F X itself

above components satisfy NATURALITY PROPERTY

COMPOSITION of two natural transformations
- components at each object X are composition of components of each transformation

NATURALITY CONDITION is satisfied
-}

{-
TODO
Exercise 16.6 Write out this construction for the case of Haskell types and Functor:
1. The identity natural transformation is a function:

       ident :: Functor f => f :=>: f

2. The composition of two natural transformations is a function:

       compos :: (Functor f, Functor g, Functor h)
              => (g :=>: h) -> (f :=>: g) -> (f :=>: h)

next step i: make End(C) into a monoidal category by providing
- bifunctor : way to combine two endofunctors into a new one

    data (f :.: g) a = Compose (f (g a)) deriving Functor

- object  : identity for this composition
  - must be an endofunctor
  â€” must be one does not add info to the composition

    data Identity a = I a deriving Functor


monad is a monoid in End(C)

to show it coincides with the definition from Chapter 1:

UNIT : 1 --Î·-> M
- 1 is identity functor; arrows are natural transformations
  - so type of
                 Î· is Identity :=>: M
  since natural transformation in Haskell represented by a polymorphic function,
  this type is equivalent to:
                 Î· :: Identity a -> M a
-- https://github.com/lambdaconf/book-of-monads/pull/156 - remove pronoun
- Identity a is simply a fancy wrapper around 'a'

UNIT SUMMARY
- unit of a monoid in the category EndpCq is function
            a -> M a
  for endofunctor M

the return operation of monad M

JOIN
MULTIPLICATION : (M biX M) --Î¼-> M
- In End(C), bifunctor biX is functor composition where the arrows are natural transformations

                 (M :.: M) :=>: M

unpack (:=>:) to get

           Î¼ :: (M :.: M) a -> M a

(M :.: M) a == M (M a) (like  (f . g) x == f (g x))

so type is

           Î¼ :: M (M a) -> M a

- hoist is the arrow part of a functor but in the category End(C)

every polymorphic function between functors is a natural transformation:

     fmap ::            (a  ->  b) -> (f a ->   f b)

only difference : kind of arrows
- fmap  : normal arrows for fmap
