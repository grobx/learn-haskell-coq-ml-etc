ABSTRACT

Blockchain technology seems to be a killer app for functional
programming languages, witnessed by companies such as IOHK,
Adjoint.IO, Digital Assert, Kadena and Tezos using Haskell and
OCaml. But what is a blockchain? This talk will show the development
of a simple blockchain in Haskell: elucidating the four main parts: 1)
the tamper-evident append-only ledger; 2) the consensus system that
decides what entries go into the ledger (and in what order); 3) the
peer-to-peer network supporting consensus; 4) the "smart contract"
system which interprets what the ledger entries mean (e.g., transfer a
coin from Alice to Bob).

The concept of a ledger is built up from simple parts:

1. A single service receives entries on multiple concurrent
   channels. Each channel grabs a lock and places their entry into the
   ledger. This is the beginnings of a ledger but it is
   not-distributed and it is open to DOS attacks by channels holding
   the lock too long.

2. In this step the channels add their entries to a pool. "Miner"
   threads pick entries from the pool and attempt to add them via
   compare-and-swap instructions. This avoids the DOS problem in #1
   but it is still not-distributed.

3. Next the system becomes distributed by making the miners into
   separate nodes on a peer-to-peer network. Network communication
   will be done via UDP. Consensus among the peers will be achieved
   via a simple Proof-of-Work mechanism.

4. Up until this step, the entries on the ledger are just
   uninterpreted bytes. This step will introduce a simple smart
   contract language for interpreting those bytes. Initially it will
   support creating named table entries and incrementing the value
   associated with the entry. Finally it will show "value" (e.g.,
   coins, property deeds) transfers between named tables entires
   (i.e., accounts) leveraging public-key cryptography.

You (a "node") have a file of transactions on your computer (a
"ledger"). Two government accountants (let's call them "miners") have
the same file on theirs (so itâ€™s "distributed"). As you make a
transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to
inform them.

Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford
it (and be paid their salary "Bitcoins"). The first to check and
validate hits "REPLY ALL", attaching their logic for verifying the
transaction ("Proof of Work"). If the other accountant agrees,
everyone updates their file.
